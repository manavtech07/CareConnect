## CareConnect CKD Portal
Kidney Disease Predictive Analysis Tool

OUR GOALS:
To determine if a patient is likely to be diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or not, we created a machine learning model with a 99.7% accuracy rate, based on easily available parameters from accessible sources such as blood test reports.
We have created a website for our CareConnect portal that has a user-friendly interface and tracks patient data. The User Interface elements for diagnosis reports, basic tracker, features, contact forms, navigation bar are ready to use.
A UI component that enables patients to get in touch with medical professionals in their area has been implemented.
The portal is completely responsive and embedded with our machine learning model in the backend at this stage.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. User authentication and authorization for secure login and access control.
2. Database integration to store user data, reports, and appointments.
3. Data visualization to display user past reports and current stage in an understandable format.
4. Integration with external APIs for real-time access to healthcare data and resources.
5. Tracker analyser system to track basic necessities to maintain kidney health, such as nutrients, fluids, meditations and workouts.
6. Integration of tracker elements with wearable OS, such as FitBits and Apple Watches: MockUp components
